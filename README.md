### Data cleaning and preprocessing
Data exploration and visualization


### Recommendations:

1) Increase the availability of classic bikes: As the most popular rideable type, it may be beneficial to increase the number of classic bikes available for rental to meet the high demand.

2) Target casual riders during the summer months: Since casual ridership tends to spike during the summer months, it may be worth targeting marketing efforts towards tourists and other casual riders during this time.

3) Consider offering discounts for off-peak hours: To encourage ridership during non-peak hours, offering discounts or promotions during these times may be an effective strategy.

4) Expand availability of electric bikes: While electric bikes have a lower usage rate compared to classic bikes, they still have a considerable number of rentals. Expanding the availability of electric bikes may attract more riders who prefer this type of rideable.

5) Increase marketing efforts during weekdays to attract more riders during slower periods.


### Conclusion
Based on the results of the analysis, Cyclistic can use the insights to tailor its marketing strategy and increase its customer base. By targeting casual riders with personalized offers and promotions, Cyclistic can encourage them to become members and increase its revenue.
